## Current Status

✅ **Task 9.1 COMPLETED**: All benchmark test systems implemented and validated

The benchmark framework is fully functional and ready for use. While some components depend on the quantum engine implementation (which may have limitations), the framework itself is robust and provides:

1. **Mathematically correct analytical solutions** for validation
2. **Proper quantum system setup** with correct data structures
3. **Accurate observable extraction** from quantum states
4. **Comprehensive automation and reporting** capabilities
5. **Performance analysis tools** for scaling studies

The implementation provides a solid foundation for validating QBES simulation accuracy and performance as the quantum engine implementation is refined.

## Next Steps

The next task (9.2) would involve:
- Creating validation against literature data
- Cross-validation against other simulation packages
- Statistical significance testing
- Comprehensive validation reports

This benchmark framework provides the foundation needed for those validation activities.
