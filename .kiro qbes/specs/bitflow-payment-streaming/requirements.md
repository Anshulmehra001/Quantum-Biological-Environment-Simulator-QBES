# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BitFlow is a cross-chain Bitcoin payment streaming protocol that enables continuous, real-time payments using Bitcoin through Starknet's ultra-low fee infrastructure. The system allows users to lock Bitcoin and stream payments continuously to recipients, enabling use cases like subscriptions, micro-payments, and pay-per-use services while maintaining Bitcoin's security properties and leveraging Starknet's scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Bitcoin holder, I want to create payment streams using my Bitcoin, so that I can make continuous payments for subscriptions or services without manual transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their Bitcoin wallet THEN the system SHALL display their available Bitcoin balance
2. WHEN a user initiates a payment stream THEN the system SHALL lock the specified Bitcoin amount in a secure escrow
3. WHEN a payment stream is active THEN the system SHALL automatically transfer payments to the recipient at the specified rate
4. IF the locked Bitcoin balance is insufficient THEN the system SHALL pause the stream and notify both parties
5. WHEN a user cancels a stream THEN the system SHALL return any remaining locked Bitcoin to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to receive continuous Bitcoin payments from my customers, so that I can offer subscription-based services with automatic billing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service provider creates a payment request THEN the system SHALL generate a unique stream identifier
2. WHEN customers subscribe to a stream THEN the system SHALL begin transferring payments at the specified rate
3. WHEN payments are received THEN the system SHALL update the provider's balance in real-time
4. IF a customer's stream stops THEN the system SHALL notify the service provider immediately
5. WHEN a provider wants to withdraw THEN the system SHALL convert Starknet assets back to Bitcoin

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to enable micro-payments for my content, so that users can pay small amounts for individual articles, videos, or API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses paid content THEN the system SHALL deduct the micro-payment from their active stream
2. WHEN micro-payments are below $0.01 THEN the system SHALL process them without significant fees
3. WHEN a user's stream balance is low THEN the system SHALL prompt them to top up before access expires
4. IF a micro-payment fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and provide clear error messaging
5. WHEN creators set pricing THEN the system SHALL enforce the specified rates automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to manage my Bitcoin payment streams on my phone, so that I can monitor and control my payments anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the mobile app THEN the system SHALL display all active streams and balances
2. WHEN a user wants to create a stream THEN the system SHALL provide a simple interface with QR code scanning
3. WHEN stream status changes THEN the system SHALL send push notifications to the user
4. IF the app is offline THEN the system SHALL cache the last known state and sync when reconnected
5. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Bitcoin user, I want my funds to remain secure during streaming, so that I don't risk losing my Bitcoin to smart contract vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bitcoin is locked THEN the system SHALL use audited smart contracts for escrow
2. WHEN cross-chain transfers occur THEN the system SHALL use established bridge protocols
3. WHEN a security issue is detected THEN the system SHALL pause all streams and protect user funds
4. IF smart contracts are upgraded THEN the system SHALL require user consent for fund migration
5. WHEN users withdraw THEN the system SHALL complete transfers within the expected timeframe

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate BitFlow into my application, so that I can accept streaming Bitcoin payments for my services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers access the API THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation and examples
2. WHEN integrating payment streams THEN the system SHALL offer SDK support for major programming languages
3. WHEN webhooks are configured THEN the system SHALL send real-time payment notifications
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and retry guidance
5. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL provide a sandbox environment with test Bitcoin

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to earn yield on my locked Bitcoin, so that my funds remain productive while streaming payments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bitcoin is locked in streams THEN the system SHALL automatically stake or lend idle portions
2. WHEN yield is generated THEN the system SHALL add earnings to the user's stream balance
3. WHEN yield strategies change THEN the system SHALL notify users and allow opt-out
4. IF yield protocols fail THEN the system SHALL protect principal Bitcoin amounts
5. WHEN users check earnings THEN the system SHALL display yield history and current rates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to set up automatic Bitcoin subscriptions for my customers, so that I can provide seamless recurring billing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating subscription plans THEN the system SHALL allow flexible pricing and duration options
2. WHEN customers subscribe THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate payment streams
3. WHEN subscription periods end THEN the system SHALL handle renewals or cancellations appropriately
4. IF payments fail THEN the system SHALL attempt retries and notify both parties
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed subscription analytics and revenue tracking
