# Requirements Document

## Introduction

QBES v1.0 has been successfully implemented with core quantum biological simulation capabilities, but initial system tests show a 64.7% success rate (11 pass, 6 fail). The v1.1 finalization project aims to transform QBES from a functional prototype into a stable, robust, and user-friendly application suitable for non-expert scientists. This involves three critical phases: stabilization to achieve 100% test success, usability enhancements to eliminate user confusion, and comprehensive documentation generation for complete user onboarding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining QBES, I want all system tests to pass consistently, so that users can rely on the software's stability and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the core test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% test success rate (17 pass, 0 fail)
2. WHEN each failed test is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify the specific root cause and implement targeted fixes
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. IF a test failure is fixed THEN the system SHALL document the fix in a CHANGELOG.md file under "Version 1.1"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a scientist with limited programming experience, I want an intuitive configuration process, so that I can set up simulations without manually editing complex YAML files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `qbes generate-config` THEN the system SHALL present an interactive wizard with simple questions
2. WHEN the wizard asks questions THEN it SHALL use plain language (e.g., "What is the path to your PDB file?" instead of technical jargon)
3. WHEN the user answers all questions THEN the system SHALL generate a perfectly formatted config.yaml file automatically
4. IF the user provides invalid input THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and allow correction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher running simulations, I want clear and informative output during execution, so that I can understand what the system is doing and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a simulation runs THEN the system SHALL display clear status messages at each major step
2. WHEN the simulation completes THEN the system SHALL print a formatted summary table of key results to the terminal
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages instead of generic failures
4. IF a common error occurs (e.g., file not found) THEN the system SHALL suggest specific solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new QBES user, I want comprehensive documentation and tutorials, so that I can learn to use the software effectively without external help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user accesses the documentation THEN they SHALL find a step-by-step tutorial covering installation through first simulation
2. WHEN a user needs reference information THEN they SHALL find complete documentation of all CLI commands and configuration parameters
3. WHEN a user encounters issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guides with common problems and solutions
4. IF documentation is provided THEN it SHALL use a simple, well-known example system for demonstrations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a clean, well-organized final deliverable, so that the software can be easily distributed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the v1.1 work is complete THEN the system SHALL be packaged as QBES_v1.1_Stable_and_Usable.zip
2. WHEN the package is created THEN it SHALL include all bug fixes, usability improvements, and documentation
3. WHEN the final deliverable is tested THEN it SHALL demonstrate 100% test success and complete functionality
4. IF the package is distributed THEN it SHALL include clear installation and usage instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a scientist using QBES for research, I want the installation process to be automated and reliable, so that I can focus on science rather than technical setup issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the installation script THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and resolve dependency issues
2. WHEN installation encounters problems THEN the system SHALL provide specific diagnostic information and suggested fixes
3. WHEN the installation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that all components are working correctly
4. IF the system is already installed THEN the upgrade process SHALL preserve user configurations and data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a computational biologist, I want the CLI to be intuitive and self-documenting, so that I can discover and use features efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs any CLI command THEN the system SHALL provide helpful usage information if arguments are missing
2. WHEN a user requests help THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive information about available commands and options
3. WHEN commands execute THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion times for long operations
4. IF a command fails THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches or parameter adjustments
