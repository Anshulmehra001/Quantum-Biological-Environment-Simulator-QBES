# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Quantum Biological Environment Simulator (QBES) is a first-of-its-kind scientific software toolkit designed to accurately simulate quantum mechanics within noisy biological environments. This system addresses the grand challenge of modeling open quantum systems in biological contexts, providing researchers with a tool to explore quantum effects in biological systems such as photosynthesis, enzyme catalysis, and neural processes. The simulator must be scientifically rigorous, computationally efficient, and accessible to researchers without extensive programming knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a computational biologist, I want to simulate quantum mechanical effects in biological systems, so that I can study phenomena like quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes or enzyme reactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a biological system configuration THEN the system SHALL initialize a quantum mechanical model based on established theoretical frameworks for open quantum systems
2. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL apply scientifically validated bio-noise models to represent environmental decoherence effects
3. WHEN the simulation completes THEN the system SHALL output quantum state evolution data that is physically plausible and within expected parameter ranges
4. IF the biological system contains more than 1000 atoms THEN the system SHALL automatically apply appropriate approximation methods to maintain computational feasibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a research scientist with limited programming experience, I want to easily configure and run quantum biological simulations, so that I can focus on scientific analysis rather than technical implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the installation script THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and install all required dependencies including Python libraries and binary dependencies
2. WHEN a user provides a PDB file and basic parameters THEN the system SHALL automatically generate appropriate quantum mechanical models without requiring manual quantum state preparation
3. WHEN a user executes the simulation THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and estimated completion times
4. IF installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to analyze and visualize quantum biological simulation results, so that I can extract meaningful scientific insights and validate my hypotheses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a simulation completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive output files including quantum state trajectories, coherence measures, and energy landscapes
2. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create publication-ready plots showing key quantum metrics over time
3. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis of quantum coherence lifetimes and decoherence rates
4. IF results appear unphysical THEN the system SHALL flag potential issues and suggest diagnostic steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a computational scientist, I want the simulator to be scientifically rigorous and well-documented, so that I can trust the results and understand the underlying theoretical foundations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is installed THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation explaining the theoretical basis for all quantum mechanical models used
2. WHEN a simulation method is selected THEN the system SHALL provide citations to relevant scientific literature supporting the chosen approach
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL include uncertainty estimates and validation metrics comparing against known benchmarks
4. IF a user requests model details THEN the system SHALL provide access to detailed mathematical formulations and parameter justifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a software user, I want the system to be robust and handle errors gracefully, so that I can successfully run simulations without encountering cryptic failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters invalid input parameters THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages explaining what needs to be corrected
2. WHEN computational resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches or parameter adjustments
3. WHEN a simulation fails mid-execution THEN the system SHALL save intermediate results and provide options for resuming
4. IF dependencies are missing or incompatible THEN the installation process SHALL detect and resolve conflicts automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher working with different biological systems, I want to configure simulations for various molecular complexes, so that I can study quantum effects across different biological contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a PDB file THEN the system SHALL automatically extract relevant molecular structure information and identify quantum-relevant subsystems
2. WHEN configuring a simulation THEN the system SHALL support common biological systems including protein complexes, DNA structures, and membrane systems
3. WHEN multiple chromophores or active sites are present THEN the system SHALL automatically identify and model quantum coupling between these elements
4. IF the molecular system is too large for full quantum treatment THEN the system SHALL apply QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics) hybrid approaches

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a computational researcher, I want the system to provide benchmarking and validation capabilities, so that I can verify the accuracy of my simulations against known results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is first installed THEN it SHALL include a suite of benchmark test cases with known expected results
2. WHEN running benchmark tests THEN the system SHALL compare computed results against reference values and report accuracy metrics
3. WHEN a new simulation is configured THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate validation approaches based on the system type
4. IF benchmark tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to help identify the source of discrepancies
