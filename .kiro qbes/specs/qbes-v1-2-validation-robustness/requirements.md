# Requirements Document

## Introduction

QBES Version 1.2 "Validation & Robustness" Release represents the final development sprint to transform QBES from a stable application into a perfected, demonstrably accurate, and robust quantum biological simulation platform. This release focuses on automated validation, advanced diagnostics, and comprehensive quality assurance to ensure scientific accuracy and user confidence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Validation Command

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a built-in validation command that automatically tests QBES against known scientific benchmarks, so that I can verify the accuracy and reliability of my simulation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes `qbes validate` THEN the system SHALL create a benchmark suite directory at `qbes/benchmarks/`
2. WHEN the benchmark suite is established THEN the system SHALL include reference data files (e.g., `fmo_3eni.pdb`) and a `reference_data.json` file with scientifically accepted results
3. WHEN the validate command runs THEN the system SHALL execute at least one analytical model benchmark and one complex model (FMO) benchmark
4. WHEN benchmark simulations complete THEN the system SHALL compare results against values in `reference_data.json`
5. WHEN validation analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a `validation_report.md` file in the user's output directory
6. WHEN the validation report is generated THEN it SHALL include an overall accuracy score and pass/fail status for each benchmark
7. WHEN the accuracy score is calculated THEN it SHALL be expressed as a percentage with at least 98% required for certification

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Debugging Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer or advanced user, I want comprehensive debugging tools including dry-run mode and detailed logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand simulation behavior without running full computations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes `qbes run --dry-run` THEN the system SHALL perform all setup and validation steps without executing the main time-evolution loop
2. WHEN dry-run mode completes setup THEN the system SHALL print a summary of the planned simulation and exit with "Dry run complete." message
3. WHEN the simulation engine runs THEN the system SHALL integrate Python's logging module for DEBUG-level messages
4. WHEN sanity checks are performed THEN the system SHALL log numerical validation results (e.g., "Density Matrix Trace = 1.00000001 (PASS)") after every N steps
5. WHEN `save_snapshot_interval` is configured THEN the system SHALL save full density matrix snapshots every N time steps
6. WHEN snapshot saving is enabled THEN the system SHALL store intermediate states to files for analysis

### Requirement 3: Self-Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want the system to autonomously validate itself and achieve perfect accuracy scores, so that I can certify the application meets scientific standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the validation suite is implemented THEN the system SHALL execute `qbes validate --suite full` autonomously
2. WHEN validation results are generated THEN the system SHALL analyze the `validation_report.md` for accuracy metrics
3. IF validation shows 100% pass rate and >98% accuracy THEN the system SHALL proceed to final packaging
4. IF any benchmark fails or accuracy is <98% THEN the system SHALL enter a debugging loop
5. WHEN in debugging mode THEN the system SHALL identify, fix, and document bugs in `CHANGELOG.md`
6. WHEN bugs are fixed THEN the system SHALL rerun validation until perfect results are achieved

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want updated documentation that explains all new features and validation capabilities, so that I can effectively use the enhanced QBES system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN v1.2 is complete THEN the `README.md` SHALL reflect new validation features and their importance
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the `USER_GUIDE.md` SHALL include detailed instructions for debugging features
3. WHEN benchmarks are implemented THEN a new `BENCHMARKS.md` document SHALL explain the scientific basis for each validation test
4. WHEN final validation succeeds THEN the perfect `validation_report.md` SHALL be included in the `docs/` folder as proof of accuracy

### Requirement 5: Final Release Packaging

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a professionally packaged v1.2 release that demonstrates perfection and scientific rigor, so that QBES can be confidently distributed to the research community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all features are implemented THEN the system SHALL perform final codebase cleanup
2. WHEN validation is perfect THEN the final `validation_report.md` SHALL be generated and archived
3. WHEN packaging begins THEN the entire project SHALL be compressed into `QBES_v1.2_Perfected_Release.zip`
4. WHEN the release is complete THEN it SHALL include all source code, documentation, tests, and validation proof
5. WHEN quality standards are met THEN the release SHALL demonstrate 100% test success and >98% scientific accuracy
