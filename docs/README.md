# Quantum Biological Environment Simulator (QBES)

A scientific software toolkit for simulating quantum mechanics within noisy biological environments.

## Overview

QBES is designed to study quantum effects in biological systems such as photosynthesis, enzyme catalysis, and neural processes. The simulator combines quantum mechanical calculations with molecular dynamics simulations to model open quantum systems in realistic biological environments.

## Key Features

- **Scientifically Rigorous**: Based on established open quantum systems theory
- **Hybrid QM/MM**: Combines quantum mechanics with molecular dynamics
- **Biological Noise Models**: Validated environmental decoherence models
- **User-Friendly**: Accessible to researchers without extensive programming knowledge
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Statistical analysis and uncertainty quantification
- **Publication-Ready Output**: Automated generation of scientific plots and figures

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

1. Prepare your molecular system (PDB file)
2. Configure simulation parameters
3. Run the simulation
4. Analyze results

```python
from qbes import ConfigurationManager, SimulationEngine

# Load configuration
config_manager = ConfigurationManager()
config = config_manager.load_config("configs/default_config.yaml")

# Run simulation
engine = SimulationEngine()
engine.initialize_simulation(config)
results = engine.run_simulation()

# Results are automatically saved and plotted
```
