QBES Quantum Simulation Results
========================================

System Configuration:
  System Type: Two-level quantum system
  Temperature: 300.0 K
  Noise Model: Protein environment (Ohmic)
  Simulation Time: 10.0 ps
  Time Steps: 101

Hamiltonian Matrix:
  [0.0  0.1]
  [0.1  2.0]  (in eV)

Key Results:
  Coherence Lifetime: 10.0 ps
  Decoherence Rate: 0.100 ps^-1
  Initial Purity: 1.000
  Final Purity: 0.684
  Initial Coherence: 1.000
  Final Coherence: 0.368

Physical Interpretation:
- The quantum system starts in a coherent superposition state
- Biological environment (protein) causes decoherence
- Coherence decays exponentially: C(t) = exp(-t/tau)
- Coherence lifetime tau = 10 ps is typical for biological systems
- This demonstrates quantum effects in photosynthesis/enzymes

Applications:
- Photosynthetic energy transfer efficiency
- Enzyme catalysis quantum tunneling
- Quantum biology research
