QBES Analysis Report
==============================

1. QUANTUM COHERENCE ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Coherence Lifetime: 20.0 ps
Decay Rate: 0.1 ps^-1
Decay Model: Exponential C(t) = exp(-0.1t)

2. PURITY EVOLUTION
------------------------------
Initial Purity: 1.000
Final Purity: 0.683
Purity Loss: 0.317

3. ENERGY CONSERVATION
------------------------------
Average Energy: 0.750 eV
Energy Fluctuation: 0.000000 eV
Energy is conserved (as expected)

4. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
------------------------------
This simulation models quantum effects in:
• Photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes
• Enzyme active sites with quantum tunneling
• Membrane protein quantum dynamics
• DNA charge transfer processes

The 20.0 ps coherence lifetime is realistic for:
• Chlorophyll molecules in photosystems
• Aromatic amino acids in proteins
• Biological chromophores at room temperature
