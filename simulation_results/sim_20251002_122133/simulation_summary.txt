QBES Simulation Results
========================================
System Configuration:
  System Type: two_level
  Temperature: 300.0 K
  Noise Model: protein_ohmic
  Simulation Time: 20.0 ps
  Time Steps: 401

Hamiltonian Matrix:
  [0.8  0.1]
  [0.1  1.5]  (in eV)

Key Results:
  Coherence Lifetime: 20.0 ps
  Decoherence Rate: 0.050 ps^-1
  Initial Purity: 1.000
  Final Purity: 0.683
  Initial Coherence: 1.000
  Final Coherence: 0.371

Physical Interpretation:
- The quantum system starts in a coherent superposition state
- Biological environment causes decoherence
- Coherence decays exponentially: C(t) = exp(-t/tau)
- Coherence lifetime tau = 20.0 ps is typical for biological systems
- This demonstrates quantum effects in photosynthesis/enzymes

Applications:
- Photosynthetic energy transfer efficiency
- Enzyme catalysis quantum tunneling
- Quantum biology research
